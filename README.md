# 2k15-html
My 2k15 theme, used in theel0ja.info in 2015 autumn. Note, that this needs mod_rewrite & PHP to work properly.

# Where to download it? Or where's the demo? And what about license?
- [Download](https://github.com/theel0ja/2k15-html/archive/master.zip)
- [Demo](https://lab.theel0ja.info/sivupohjat/2k15-html/)
- [License](LICENSE)

Due to license terms, you need to download [Disko](http://www.dafont.com/disko.font) font yourself, and put it to "/styles/Disko.ttf"

# To-Do List
- Nothing...
